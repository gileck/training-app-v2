# Implementation Tasks

This document breaks down the tasks needed to implement the Training App based on the Project Definition Document.

*General Guideline: Always consult and follow the rules defined in the `app-guildelines` directory.*

After finishing each task:
* Run `yarn checks` and fix all the project issues
* Mark the completed tasks as done
* Plan the next tasks and let me know what you plan to implement them (do not implement them until I tell you too.)


OPEN TASKS:

# show indication that an exercise was added to a workout
# add the ability to add multiple exercises to a workout at the same time (checkbox)
# close the add exercise dialog after adding an exercise (only when it was successful)
# fix "Failed to remove exercise: Exercise not found in this workout. when removing an exercise from a workout"
